👋 Hey, I’m @jjingofarouk
💻 Front-End Specialist | Full-Stack Doc 
🚀 I’m a practicing doctor who codes like it’s my second heartbeat. I also blend patient care with tech that delivers. I’m hooked on building sharp front-end experiences and solving problems with precision. When I’m not in the clinic or coding, I’m playing chess and tinkering with my Mac. Always chasing the next big idea.
