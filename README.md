👋 Hey, I’m @jjingofarouk
💻 Front-End Specialist | Full-Stack Doc

🚀 I’m a practicing doctor who codes like it’s my second heartbeat. I also blend patient care with tech that delivers. I’m hooked on building sharp front-end experiences and solving problems with precision. When I’m not in the clinic or coding, I’m playing chess and tinkering with my Mac—always chasing the next big idea.

🌱 What I’m Learning

🔹 Front-End Expertise – Crafting scalable SPAs with React and Angular, managing state with Redux/NgRx, optimizing with lazy-loaded components and SSR, and shipping responsive designs via Tailwind and CSS-in-JS 

🔹 Python – Building RESTful APIs with FastAPI, leveraging asyncio for high-throughput backends, and crunching data with Pandas/NumPy for actionable outputs 

🔹 Machine Learning – Training models with TensorFlow and scikit-learn, tuning hyperparameters for ROC-AUC gains, and deploying lightweight predictors 

🔹 Cloud Engineering – Orchestrating deployments with AWS ECS and Azure DevOps, automating pipelines with Terraform, and scaling with serverless architectures 

🔹 Distributed Systems – Designing microservices with Docker, syncing via Kafka event streams, and ensuring resilience with circuit breakers and retry policies
